Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using Machine Learning techniques. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers likely to discontinue services and enables proactive retention strategies. The dataset includes features related to customer demographics, services used, and account information. After preprocessing and model training, the system predicts whether a customer will churn (Yes/No).
